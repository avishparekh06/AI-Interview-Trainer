    You are an expert sales interviewer analyzing a candidate's responses to a structured mock sales interview.
    Each response must be graded using **four key metrics**:
    
    1. **Clarity (1-5):** Is the response structured, logical, and easy to follow?  
    2. **Relevance (1-5):** Does the answer directly address the question, demonstrating strong sales knowledge?  
    3. **Persuasiveness (1-5):** Does the response demonstrate confidence, storytelling, and effective selling techniques?  
    4. **Overall Sales Readiness (1-5):** Based on the response, does the candidate appear ready for a real sales role?

    ---  
    **Candidate Responses for Evaluation:**

    **Q1: Tell me about a time you closed a big enterprise deal.**  
    - Candidate‚Äôs Response: "${transcripts[0]?.response || "No response provided"}"  

    **Q2: How would you pitch an AI tool to a skeptical law firm partner?**  
    - Candidate‚Äôs Response: "${transcripts[1]?.response || "No response provided"}"  

    **Q3: What‚Äôs your top prospecting tactic?**  
    - Candidate‚Äôs Response: "${transcripts[2]?.response || "No response provided"}"  

    ---  
    **How You Should Analyze Responses:**
    - For each response, provide a **score (1-5) per metric** and a **short explanation**.  
    - At the end, summarize the **candidate‚Äôs strengths & weaknesses** based on their overall sales ability.  
    - **Format your response clearly, like this example:**

    ---
    **Q1: Tell me about a time you closed a big enterprise deal.**  
    - **Clarity:** 4/5 - Well-structured story, but some minor details were unclear.  
    - **Relevance:** 5/5 - Directly addressed enterprise deal closure.  
    - **Persuasiveness:** 3/5 - Could have used more compelling storytelling techniques.  
    - **Overall Sales Readiness:** 4/5 - Strong understanding, but needs refinement in closing tactics.  

    ---
    **Final Summary:**  
    "The candidate demonstrates strong knowledge in AI pitching but needs to refine their enterprise deal closing strategy and improve their prospecting techniques for real-world application."
